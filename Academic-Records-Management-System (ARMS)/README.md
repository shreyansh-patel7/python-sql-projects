📘 Academic Records Management System (ARMS)

📌 Project Overview

Academic Records Management System (ARMS) is a console-based Python & SQLite application designed to manage student academic records efficiently.
The system allows users to add, view, search, update, and delete student records with permanent data storage using a relational database.
This project focuses on data persistence, structured access, and user-friendly interaction, making it more advanced and interactive than a basic student record system.

🎯 Motivation

After implementing a basic Student Management System, this project was developed to explore additional features and better system design, such as:

Updating existing student details

Searching students by ID or name

Using a real database instead of temporary file storage

Improving user interaction with a structured, menu-driven interface

ARMS represents a more refined and feature-rich approach to academic data management.
